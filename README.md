Assignment 3: Twitter API 
“What’s for Dinner, Chef Twitter?” 

To represent data pulled from Twitter’s API, I decided to create a random food generator based on hashtags predefined by myself. I was inspired by the idea because I personally have used random generators for several things: coming up with ideas, names for characters, and even what to eat, etc. I thought the best way to approach this project was to use a general idea that could be understood by anyone without background context, and food seemed like a guarantee. 

Each button represents a type of food divided into: main foods, vegetables, and a dessert. At first, I considered to have the interface set up so that it would max out based on the number of clicks for each div box, and then it would generate the user’s final random recipe. However, the beauty in most generators is that it usually only requires one button to cycle through a list of data and without any awkward refreshes of a separate button for the user to click on. For this reason, I decided to leave it so that the user could quickly cycle through each category and not be stuck with the same food item, essentially building their perfect recipe. For example, pizza and corn might not make the best main and side combination, but steak and corn seems quite appealing. I wanted to incorporate sound and did this with a ding sound effect that some restaurants use to indicate “order up!”. In the future, this could definitely include more categories or keywords in general because of the mass amounts of data available on Twitter’s API, and well, internet user’s love for tweeting about their food.
